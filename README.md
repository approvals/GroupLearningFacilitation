# GroupLearningFacilitation
Printouts to help facilitate a randori/mob programming session of koans

** Collecting Obversations **
Before collecting Obversations I usually show 3 videos
1) [selective attention test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo)
2) [Faa Baa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lN8vWm3m0) (First 2 minutes)
3) [Assumptions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNbF006Y5x4)
and this slide show
4) [Sticky Notes](http://www.slideshare.net/llewellynfalco/sticky-notes-36467650)

When asking for observations it is useful to give smaller areas to help people. 
For example, instead of 
"Please give me observations about anything"

try
"There are no invalid observations, You can have observation about the tools, the code, the lanuages, the group dynamics, your feelings or any of the apis"

When reading obversations try to group them by placing simular things near each other and disimular things farther apart.

** Sticky Notes **
bring sharpies to write with. Before the slide show I usually point out that common sense is simply things we have learned, then forgotten we ever learned and assumed we knew all along. 

I also point out that humans exhibit 'flight or fight' responses and many people will not read the orange sticky notes, but will simply zone out and skim them.
